## My process

I first sketched out the design in my notebook and divided the components into sections after which I assigned class names and its design characteritics.

I intially designed the desktop view first but i couldnt implement the phone view in media query so i switched the css code and put the desktop view in media query

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learnt how to deploy using github pages

### Continued development

I should go over media query again
